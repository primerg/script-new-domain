script-new-domain
=================

A bash script that automatically setup a new virtual setup in apache. This was created and tested for an ubuntu setup. Should be used as a general template for other setup.

1. Move ths create.sh anywhere you want
2. Move the template file in /etc/apache2/sites-available

I found this script in a forum and modified it for my own use.
